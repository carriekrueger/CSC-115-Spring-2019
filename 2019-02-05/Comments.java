// Chapter 2 Notes: Comments

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        comments();  // in this method we will explore comments
    }
    
    // a method to investigate comments
    public static void comments() {
        
        // anything you type in a comment is ignored by the compiler
        
        // We use comments for:
        // -Adding your name to the program 
        // -Adding a brief description of the program 
        // -As you go along, explain to yourself and others what your 
        // code does/should do
        
        // Also.. DEBUGGING
        // If there is code that doesn't work (yet...)
        // If there are a bunch of lines of code that don't work
        // and you want to isolate the error 
        
        // GIVE CREDIT
        // If you use someone else's code, use comments to credit them 
        // and include the place where you got it from
        
        // ex. shamelessly stolen from https://github.com/awesomecoder
        
        
        // HOW DO WE MAKE COMMENTS?
        
        // Line comments: anything after the // is not read by the compiler
        // Block comments: /* */ (slash star star slash) (comment sandwich)
        // Java Doc comments /** */ (will automatically generate documentation)
        //                          (we won't use these yet)
        
        
        // Examples 
        
        /* When you have mutliple lines of comments
           it's helpful to do a block comment 
           you can add as many lines as you want!
           Good for top of program name/description
        */
